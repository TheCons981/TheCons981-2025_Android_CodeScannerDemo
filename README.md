# Code Scanner Demo

**Code Scanner Demo**, a lightweight Android (Kotlin+Jetpack Compose) demo project created to refresh some details before going on with the refactoring of my prduction project after almost two years of inactivity in native development. The app allows users to **scan, select, or generate various types of QR codes and barcodes**, with the ability to save them locally. The project demonstrates best practices for modern Android photo and data handling.
(The focus was not on the UI, so no particular attention was given to details).
